# LAB QUIZ 00

You have **25 minutes** to complete the following tasks.

You are free to use any resources you want, _with the exception of any other person, online or otherwise_.

If you pass (see RUBRIC below), you will be able to convert up to 5 **late** skill drill submissions to **on time**.

## TASKS

Feel free to perform these tasks in any order.

### REPL<span>.</span>IT

Log onto REPL.IT and do the following:

1. Complete `lab quiz drill 00`.

### INS

Log onto INS and do the following:

1. Copy the directory `/users/library/csis/comp1501/quizzes/quiz-00` to your home directory.
1. Create a Java source file called `Quiz` in the `src` directory inside the `quiz-00` directory. This source file should compile without errors, but doesn't need to do anything else.
1. Create a Java source file called `Main` in the same directory as `Quiz`. This source file should have a static main. The main should use System.out.println to print out "Hello, World!" to the screen. The source file should compile without errors and when you run it, should display "Hello, World!" to the console.
1. Submit the `quiz-00` directory using `submit1501`. When asked for the task identifier, use `quiz0`.

Confirm you are watching the repos you were supposed to watch in lab.00.
